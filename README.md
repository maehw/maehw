### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am interested in wired & wireless communications, radio frequency, software defined radios (SDR), hamradio, digital signal processing and digital signal processors (DSP), software development and engineering (with a focus on embedded systems), reverse engineering, IT security, space stuff & other things. This is also what most of my git repositories are about.
